- Walk into one of the cells to join the game.
- Wait until it is your time to spawn.
- Kill everyone else, including other players
  to win the game.
- If the game has allready started or you died
  you can not rejoin. You must wait until the
  round is over. Don´t worry: a game takes only
  a few minutes. You can spectate other players 
  with one of the monitors.


Known bugs:
- Sometimes killed enemies will not drop
  weapons.
- Sometimes you can not pick up more than one
  weapon of the same kind.
- Sometimes weapons will appear in the spawn
  area.
