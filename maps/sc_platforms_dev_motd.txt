In the reactor room, there are 64 platforms, each showing the face of 
one of the four scientists.

A screen on the wall will indicate which platform will remain and 
which will disappear.

Your goal is to position yourself on the correct platform before the 
others disappear. The speed will increase in each phase, challenging 
you to survive the 6 stages.

Good luck!

For 2 to 32 players.
