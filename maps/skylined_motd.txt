Welcome to New York, men. You've been called
in to find a team we lost a few days ago.

They drove their vehicle to the garage of their
target destination, and wasn't heard from after
that. You must find the team, and bring them
back to head quarters for de-briefing. You'll be
picked up at the roof of the structure.

Keep in mind the previous actions of the militia
in the building and their in-humane ways. They will
do everything it takes to try and stop you. As
such, you must eliminate each of them in your
area before moving on for your own safety. Leave
no wounded, take no prisoners.

You're supplied with our standards, but we've
decided you may need some more things. You've
been given medical kits, and alien devices that
we have deemed useful. In the past your team has
somehow posed the need for a wrench, so you have
a few of those too.
