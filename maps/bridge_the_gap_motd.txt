Description:
Those pesky HECU boys are at it again. Just look at what they've gone and done this time.
Lowering the bridge leading to the surface elevator and then sealing off the control room.
Even worse than that, this part of the facilty is crawling with Xenians and their ongoing dispute with...
the Black Mesa Science Team over how dead they should be doesn't appear to be easing off at all!
