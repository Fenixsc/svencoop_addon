Santa's Workshop by rSnake and Andy
_______________________________


It's almost Christmas and you and your friends are on the late-late shift at Santa's Workshop. Something is amiss however, and Santa will need your help solving the issues facing
each floor of the workshop if Christmas is to be saved!

3 players are needed at a bare minimum to complete the map, though you will find it much easier with a fourth.

All the puzzles in this map revolve around the concept of two teams - Green and Yellow. Each player is assigned to a team, and teams can only interact with coloured surfaces, buttons,
and doors which match their team colour. e.g. Yellow team members can walk on yellow floors, but not on green floors.

Your current team is displayed on your HUD on the left hand-side. Each player will also have an icon above their player model showing which team they are on.

You can switch to the Green or Yellow team by typing .green or .yellow respectively in chat.
